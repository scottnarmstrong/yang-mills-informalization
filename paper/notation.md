# Notation — dalmatian, 2026-11-11

| Symbol | Meaning | Definition / restriction |
|---|---|---|
| m,G,g | matrix size, closed subgroup of U(m), real one-parameter Lie algebra | public gauge definition; disconnected allowed |
| N,p,k | ultraviolet index, volume index, refinement index | natural numbers start at zero |
| a_N,D_N,L_p | spacing, inverse spacing, physical side | positive integer D,L strictly increasing |
| W, T | Wilson family, its set of observable indices (calligraphic letters) | chosen before volume sequence |
| I,M,C | insertion, lattice moment, smeared moment | the actual Wilson law |
| Conf_n | distinct Euclidean points | joint compactly supported tests avoid diagonals |
| x=(vec x,t) | spacetime; fourth coordinate time | Euclidean pairing in Fourier phase |
| mathcal H,mathcal L,mathcal D,Omega,Phi | Hilbert space, field labels, domain, vacuum, fields | full word-span domain; no finite-dimensional space of field labels assumed |
| T(b),E,U(g),rho(g) | translations, spectral measure, Poincaré action on states and field labels | T(b) distinct from calligraphic set of observable indices |
| F_d,mathbb F,iota_d,pi | normed finite-degree spaces, disjoint union, maps to field labels, projection of observable indices | degree is an index; no inclusions in public definition |
| X,nu,xi_* | compact metric phase space, Borel probability, selected phase | lattice limit is mixture |
| S^s,mathsf F_n | Euclidean correlations, ordered-time continuation | s in X disjoint union {mix} |
| Ch_j,O_{j,kappa},c_{j,kappa} | finite channel set, field, OPE coefficient | one choice before all spectators/states/truncations |
| w(a),D | sum of cluster degrees, OPE cutoff degree | D distinct from calligraphic domain |
| Theta,G_Theta,A_G | degree-four trace-test field, time-axis pair, positive amplitude | public test alone does not identify a stress tensor |
| mathsf m,j,q,h | mass, numerator degree, time order, real continuous homogeneous numerator | finite Wick comparison class only |

Shared macros are deliberately small. Propose additions in the dalmatian Requests section of your own notes. Local aliases cannot change a shared symbol's meaning. Internal jet coefficient spaces may be V_d; keep them distinct from F_d. Reserve b for the positive block penalty only in the construction; b_* is the public bare-coupling slope.

## Link conventions and terminology (updated in round 4)

Feedback `feedback/round-1.md` governs. All public definitions are in Part I section Definitions. Ordinary quotients use `\frac` even inline; slashes in quotient groups/spaces remain mathematical quotient notation. T remains the source-compatible symbol for a set of **observable indices**; it carries no degree or linear-space structure in the public definition. Sigma_v is a finite set of sites. A test is **supported inside volume p** exactly when its closed support lies in the open centred physical box. No mathematical data were changed by these terminology revisions.

Property labels: reg:1–4; wightman:0–3; hierarchy:1–8; recon:1–15; ope:1–2; trace:1–4; main:1–4. Use ref for every mention and both endpoints of a range. The test aliases def:separated-test and def:admissible-test resolve to def:tests and def:admissible; the canonical gauge action display is eq:gauge-transform.


## Standing round-4 terminology

Use **observable index** for v in T, **classical observable polynomial** (then polynomial) for v in V_d, **continuum field** for A in F_d, and **field label** for ell in L. Definition `def:observables` explains why a fixed observable index is separate from its changing lattice formula; `eq:observable-insertion` gives that formula's domain. `eq:observable-field-maps` in `def:hierarchy` displays the maps through the three spaces. The construction chooses indices (d,v), but the public T remains an arbitrary set. Never rename the stable labels that contain the historical word labels merely to enforce the new prose terminology.

Sites are the points of Lambda_ell (`def:lattice`). Shared objects must have displayed definitions outside proofs; recall their defining labels at distant reuse. Every owned section has a symbol/term self-check table in its owner's notes. British spelling with -ise endings is standing for reader-facing text and comments; preserve Lean identifiers, quoted text and cited titles. Technical TeX spellings such as `center`, `xcolor` and TikZ `align=center` are commands, not prose.
